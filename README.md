# NLP Projects Repository

Welcome to my NLP Projects Repository! This repository is a collection of various Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects and experiments. It includes implementations, fine-tuning, and deployment of different models and architectures.

## Projects Overview

### Base-Model-Charbot/llama3-chatbot
This directory contains the base model for a chatbot using the LLaMA3 architecture. It serves as the foundation for further fine-tuning and customization.

### Fine-Tuning/LLAMA3.1
Here, you'll find the fine-tuned versions of the LLaMA3 model. This includes adjustments and optimizations made to improve performance on specific tasks.

### Flowise
Flowise is a project focused on creating and managing workflows for NLP tasks. It includes tools for automating data pipelines and model deployment.

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
This project explores the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation models, which combine the strengths of retrieval-based and generative models for enhanced performance.

### Simple-Transformers-Architecture
A simplified implementation of transformer models for educational purposes. This project is designed to help understand the core concepts of transformer architectures.

### finance-analyst
This project applies NLP techniques to financial data analysis. It includes sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and other relevant methods tailored for the finance domain.

### foundation-model-compression
This directory contains experiments and techniques for compressing large foundation models to make them more efficient and deployable on resource-constrained devices.
